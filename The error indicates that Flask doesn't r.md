The error indicates that Flask doesn't recognize the `db` command, which is part of **Flask-Migrate**. Here's how to resolve it step by step:

### 1. Install Flask-Migrate
Ensure you have Flask-Migrate installed in your environment:
```bash
pip install flask-migrate
```

### 2. Configure Flask-Migrate
In your Flask app (`app.py`), set up Flask-Migrate. Update the imports and add the initialization:
```python
from flask_migrate import Migrate

# After initializing `db`
migrate = Migrate(app, db)
```

### 3. Initialize Migration Directory
Run the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
flask db init
```

This creates a `migrations/` directory in your project.

### 4. Create and Apply Migrations
After defining your models or making changes, follow these steps:

#### Create a Migration Script:
```bash
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
```

#### Apply the Migration:
```bash
flask db upgrade
```

### 5. Common Troubleshooting Steps
#### Verify Flask Application Environment:
Make sure the Flask app is set correctly. Run:
```bash
set FLASK_APP=app.py
```

If you're still facing issues, ensure the file path is accurate or provide the path explicitly:
```bash
set FLASK_APP=path_to_your_app.py
```

#### Activate Virtual Environment:
Ensure you're in the correct virtual environment where Flask-Migrate is installed:
```bash
env\\Scripts\\activate
```

### Summary
Once Flask-Migrate is configured, you can handle database migrations seamlessly. Let me know if you encounter further issues!
